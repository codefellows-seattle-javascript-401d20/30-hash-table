#### BinarySearchTree
```
My `BinarySearchTree` constructor is written using ES6 class syntax
There are three prototype methods
  -an `insert` method that appends a node to the BST
  -a `remove` method that removes a node from a BST
  -a `find` method that takes in a predicate function and returns a node
```
#### HashTable
```
The `HashTable` constructor has four methods
  -a `_hash` method that creates a keys hash
  -a `set` method that stores the given key value pair
  -a `get` method that retrieves the value for a given key
  -a `remove` method that removes a key value pair from the HashTable
* Each bucket index stores collisions in a BST
```
